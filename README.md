# Aerosol_particle_charging_1d_model

## 1. Introduction

This repository contains a population balance model for particle charging through 2 mechanisms namely diffusion and field charging. The model also considers  the particle electrophoretic deposition in an electrostatic precipitator (ESP).

## 2. Installation

Download the current version of the code

    git clone git@github.com:Aerosol-Lab/Aerosol_particle_charging_1d_model.git
    
Then install the code by running:
	
    make
	
It will create a virtual environment called venv. Activate the venv by running:

    source venv/bin/activate

For Jupyter Notebook users just run:

    jupyter notebook

Then navigate to the Examples folder and run the codes.

## 3. Examples

A Jupyter Notebook example to execute the code is provided in the folder [Examples](https://github.com/Aerosol-Lab/Aerosol_particle_charging_1d_model/tree/main/Examples).

## 4. Documentation

More documentation including the reference article will be included later. For the moment the examples are self-explained.
